# insecure-kubernetes-workloads
Manifests for Kubernetes workloads that violate security practices

## Warning
These workloads are insecure by design - they are used to trigger warnings and alarms in kubernetes security monitoring tools. They should be deployed carefully, in full knowledge of the vulnerabilities they expose. Absolutely no responsibility or liability is taken or assumed if you execute these manifests on your Kubernetes infrastructure.
